The Pokemon series games are RPG adventure style games developed by Game Freak,
and hosted on the Nintendo consoles. Pokemon Sword and Pokemon Shield are the
most recent additions to the series, released less than a month ago.

What is Pokemon?
----------------

Pokemon has pretty much become a genre in the world of video games, the idea
of catching monsters to put them in your team is very creative and unorthodox
with the flood of triple A FPS games out there.

In every pokemon game, you start out in a small town, where some sort of
circumstances lead to you picking your first Pokemon. This leads you on to your
journey of defeating 8 Gym Leaders, receiving a badge from them, using those
badges to fight the Elite Four, and ultimately fighting the Champion and
becoming the new Champion. There is also always an enemy team who has some
sort of mal-intent idea against the Pokemon world, and it ends up being your
job to stop them. This also usually ends up getting involved with the main
Legendary Pokemon, which is usually seen as a myth by the people of that
respective region.

With the story generally playing out the same, this journey takes place in the
region of Galar, based on Europe. The region has plenty of references to the
country's love for soccer, through the fire type starter whose attacks revolve
around kicking, and the gyms, which are actually just giant soccer stadiums with
many people watching your battle.

Controversy
-----------

During the development of the game, it was announced that Game Freak was cutting
the available Pokemon in half from recent games. Clearly meaning that some
player's favorite Pokemon were not included in the game. The reasoning behind
not including all of the Pokemon was to put more attention on making animations
more fluid and overall better looking. When the trailers and eventually the
full game dropped, it was revealed that many of the animations and models
were reused from the previous games, making the 'Dexit,' as it was called,
completely unnecessary.

This was clearly stated as a major criticism of the game, but that didn't stop
more than 6 million copies of the game being sold.
