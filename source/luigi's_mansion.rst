Secret Mansion
---------------

After beating the game, if you go to professor E. Gadd he will have another option
called "Secret mansion". The secret mansion looks exactly like the normal one. There are
differences, however. Luigi's vacuum has more power than normal, but ghosts have more health
and deal more damage to Luigi. Boo's run away much faster when being chased. There is more cash
in this mansion, letting luigi be able to achieve the game's A rank that's rewarding when beating
the game with a certain amount of cash. In the PAL version of Luigi's mansion, the secret
mansion is mirrored.
