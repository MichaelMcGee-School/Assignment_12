Stranded Deep
=============

*Page author: Carter Fricke*

The game features a dynamic weather and day-night cycle. Also featured
is a building system, whereby players are able to settle on an island
and construct a shelter or a raft with which to explore the ocean, and a
crafting system, whereby resources can be harvested and combined in order
to create equipment. Resources are limited, and therefore need to be
managed. As supplies that players are able to carry are limited, items
need to be prioritized for the task at hand.
Players need to manage their vitals of health, hunger, thirst, and sleep,
against the elements they face, and are able to search sunken shipwrecks
and islands for interesting and rare equipment.

Stranded Deep Rating
--------------------

Stranded deep is a very fun single player survival game and has a lot of
thing to keep you busy within the game. However, the islands are extremely
far apart which causes a pain staking journey every time you have to move to
a different one. The sharks in the water always knock you off course,
storms happen way too often, and the current seems to always be against you.
All in all it is a fun game with some issues. Our rating is a 6.5/10.
