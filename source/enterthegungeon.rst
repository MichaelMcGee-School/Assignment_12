Enter The Gungeon

*Page Author: Levi Benes*

Enter The Gungeon is a rogue-like dungeon crawler developed by Dodge Roll. It is made
in a pixel-art style, invoking a level of nostalgia while still being a recent game.
The game is critically acclaimed, with very high ratings, including Steam's 10/10
and GameStop's 4.7/5.

What is the Game?
-----------------

Being a rogue-like dungeon crawler, you are thrown into a dungeon, in which you
progress through each room, eventually finding and defeating a boss, which
allows you to advance to the next floor. The rogue-like aspect means that
there are almost constantly enemies on the screen and encourages very
fast paced gameplay. This game also falls under the category of "bullet-hell"
which means that there are a lot of projectiles on the screen at one time to
dodge.

Game Basics
~~~~~~~~~~~

At the start of a run, you fall into the dungeon, and depending on the character
you chose, you get a starting weapon with infinite ammo and a passive ability. You start
with 3 hearts, taking half a heart of damage every time you are hit. You also have the
ability to dodge roll, which moves you in whatever direction, making you invulnerable to
taking damage during the moment you are rolling. This can also be used to clear small
gaps in the floor.

The main enemies you'll see are bullets wielding guns that shoot bullets. This
is one of many of the humorous creative aspects of the game, which is mostly
characterized by the large amount of gun or bullet puns, such as a boss being
named the "Dragun."

To best illustrate some of the hilarious boss names in this game, here is a
list of all the main bosses.

* Bullet King
* Gatling Gull
* Trigger Twins
* Ammoconda
* Beholster
* The Gorgun
* Cannonbalrog
* Mine Flayer
* Treadnaught
* High Priest
* Kill Pillars
* Wallmonger
* High Dragun


As you progress through rooms, you may come across chests that drop more guns
or more items that have passives. Bosses also drop these items, as well as an extra
heart if you defeat them without taking any damage.

Overall
-------

The game is an amazing single player time waster, and is even more fun when you have
friends to play local co-op with. The game's difficulty makes it just hard enough to
want to keep coming back to it, but not too hard that you will close the game in rage
on your third death to the basic low level enemy. You quickly learn what types of movements
you want to make against certain enemies, and what their movement patterns are as well.
