League of Legends
=================

League of Legends is a free to play team-based MOBA, largely known as
one of the most popular games in existence. The game is largely
competitive, with a major focus on ranked play, as well as professional
competitive play, including the League of Legends World Championships.

How do you play LoL?
--------------------

League of Legends is a very complex game, and for the purposes of this
website, the information given will only scratch the surface of the
many intricacies within League of Legends.

The Map
~~~~~~~

League of Legends matches take place on Summoner's Rift, best described
as a massive square shaped forest with three lanes, and each team's nexus
in either corner. The main goal of the game is to destroy the enemy's
nexus, residing on the opposite corner of the map. Each of the three
lanes has turrets which go out towards the middle of the map, which
protect from the enemy getting to your nexus. It is the job of each
'laner' to defend these turrets, and ultimately the nexus, whilst
pushing to destroy the enemy's.

Champions and Abilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In League of Legends, as of December 2019, there are 147 champions
available to play, with the 148th champion, Aphelios, currently
being in playtest phase.

Every champion in the game has a basic attack, 4 abilities, and a
passive. These abilities are assigned to the keys Q, W, E, and R,
with R being considered the 'ultimate' ability for most champions.
The only champion who does not follow this rule is Aphelios, who
does not have an E ability.

Champions tend to be divided into the 5 major roles, although many
champions are played in multiple roles. These roles are Top, Jungle,
Middle, Bottom, and Support. The Top, Middle, and Bottom roles each go
to their respective lane, the Jungle roams around the area between
the lanes (called the Jungle), and the Support goes bottom lane with
Bottom.

Top laners are generally tanks and fighters, Junglers are generally
tanks, fighters, or assassins, Mid laners are generally mages or
assassins, Bot laners are mostly marksmen, and Supports are supports,
tanks, or mages. These are simply general rules, and are usually up
for question whenever the meta shifts around, for example, during
season 7, when mages were played in the Bottom role.

Laning, Minons, and CS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each lane consists of two outer turrets, an inhibitor turret, and an
inhibitor, which all protect the two nexus turrets and the nexus. The
very outer turret is divided into 5 sets of 'turret plating' for the
first 14 minutes. Destroying each plate grants extra gold, but after
14 minutes, they will fall off, and no one will receive the extra gold
for destroying them. Behind the third turret in each lane, the inhibitor
turret, lies the inhibitor. The inhibitor does not shoot or anything,
it is only a building which has health. When destroyed, the team who
destroyed the inhibitor will start spawning super minions from their
nexus (more on this later).

In each lane, minions are sent out from the nexus, consisting of 3
melee minions and 3 caster minions per wave, in which a wave is sent
out every 30 seconds, 1 minute and 5 seconds after the game starts.
During the first 20 minutes, every 3 waves, an additional minion will
spawn in between the three melees and three casters, called a cannon
minion. This minion has more health, deals more damage, and drops
significantly more gold when destroyed than other minions. After 20
minutes, this minion spawns in every other wave, and after 35 minutes,
it spawns in every wave. The special minions called super minions, which
spawn after the destruction of an inhibitor, have an even larger amount
of health and damage than the cannon minions, and can destroy other minions
with a single hit. This causes lanes which have a super minion in them
to push towards the enemy's turrets very quickly.

When a champion destroys a minion, getting the final hit on it, the
minion drops gold and adds 1 to the player's Creep Score, or CS. CS
is used as a general measurement of how much gold a player has, since
that is the primary source of gold generation for the Top, Middle,
and Bottom roles.
