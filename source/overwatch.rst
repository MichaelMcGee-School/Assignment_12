Overwatch
=========

Overwatch is a competitive class-based first-person shooter developed by
Blizzard. It is very team oriented, and has a large professional competitive
following in the Overwatch League, also encouraging competitive play in
lower skill levels as well.

The Basics
----------

Overwatch is a class-based shooter, seemingly largely influenced by the Valve
game, TF2, meaning there are multiple characters which fill certain roles for
the team. As of December 2019, there are 31 playable heroes, each with a basic
shooting ability, 2 other abilities, and an ultimate ability, consisting of the
Damage, Tank, and Support roles. Each role has certain responsibilities, and
within each role, each hero generally plays the same, but there are also
role divisions within each role as well.

Damage
~~~~~~

Damage, or more commonly known as the DPS role, does exactly that: dish out
damage to the enemy team. There are divisions within this role, but the names
are not as clear cut within the community. For purposes of this page, we will
put these role divisions into Flankers, Sustained Damage, and Burst Damage.

Flankers are characterized by having movement abilities, and being able to
get behind the enemy team and force them to put resources into dealing with
you. These characters want to pick off the enemy who has strayed too far from
their group, or the healer that is sitting in the back lines.Some examples
of heroes that fit into this role are Genji, Tracer, and Doomfist.

Sustained Damagers do just that, continually damage the enemy's front line,
with the goal of destroying shields. Examples of these kinds of heroes are
Soldier: 76, Junkrat, and Bastion.

Burst Damagers simply deal a lot of damage in a short amount of time. Some
Sustained Damagers also fit into this class, but are better described as
Sustained Damagers. This class includes the 2 damaging snipers, Hanzo and
Widowmaker, as well as Mei, who has more defensive abilities.

Tank
~~~~

Tanks are the front line of your team. They are generally the ones to engage
fights, and have a lot of health. They also tend to have shields, though
not all of the tanks have shields. Tanks are generally categorized into
Main Tank and Off Tank.

Main Tanks are the ones with the shields that are always at the front of a
fight. Their main job is to keep the shield up, and protect the rest of their
team from taking damage. They also are the tanks with the most health

Off Tanks are characterized by not having a shield, and have abilities that
aren't characteristic of main tanks. Roadhog, Zarya, and Wrecking Ball are
all Off Tanks. Roadhog has abilities based around allowing him to get kills,
with a hook and an ability to take less damage and heal himself. Zarya is
a more complex tank, with the ability to shield herself and her allies, and
gain damage based on how much damage those shields take. Wrecking Ball is very
mobile, and can damage and displace enemies by running into them at high speeds.

Tank combinations are crucial in team composition. Certain Main Tanks work
really well with Off Tanks, such as Orisa and Roadhog or Reinhardt and Zarya.
Not utilizing these combinations usually means you will lose, and it is
similar for the two divisions of Supports as well.

Support
~~~~~~~

Supports are categorized by having abilities to heal your allies. Like Tanks,
Supports are split into Main Heals and Off Heals. Main Healers can do a lot
of healing in a short amount of time, or in a very wide area, such as Ana and
Moira, and in some cases Baptiste. Off healers have other abilities that support
the team in other ways, such as Zenyatta's Orb of Discord which makes the
enemy take more damage, and Lucio's Speed Boost, which speeds up the team.

Also like Tanks, Supports need to utlize combinations in order to be successful,
however, it is not as set in stone as Tank is. It generally just needs to be
at least one Main Healer with an Off Healer, and you will get just the right
amount of healing and other useful abilities.
