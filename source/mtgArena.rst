Rules
-----

Magic The Gathering is a complex game, but MTGA guides you through the rules as you learn.
Here is a general layout of how a game will play.

#. Players start with seven cards in their hand
#. Players play up to one land each turn.

    * These lands can be turned sideways or tapped for mana. This mana is then used to cast spells

#. Once players have enough land to tap for mana, they can cast spells by tapping an appropriate amount of mana for the spell.

    * (This is notated in the upper right hand corner of each card)

#. Players can the other player in an attempt to lower their opponent's life total to 0.

    * A player's starting life total is 20

#. Turns progress as such until one player's life total is **0**.

Building your collection

As you win games, you will earn gold to spend on card packs or on draft tournaments.
Buying packs will give you cards to put into your collection.
Participating in draft events allows you to build a deck using packs you open
and play against others who have done the same.

Winning games in an event grants you more **cards, gems, and gold** to further build your collection.
