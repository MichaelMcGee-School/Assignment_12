Unlocking Swords
````````````````
You can unlock different sword skins by playing the game and improving as a player.
Some of these are unlocked by cutting lots of the same type of fruit.
Others can be unlocked through high scores and playing with other unlocked swords.

While these swords don't add to your score in games, they certainly add to the enjoyment
and fun had while playing the game.
