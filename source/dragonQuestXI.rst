Dragon Quest XI
===============

Dragon Quest XI is the 11th installment in the Dragon Quest game series.
These turn-based strategy games involve fantasy settings in which the hero must
defeat a great evil threatening the land.

While the setting is usually ery serious, the series never fails to introduce
comedy through puns and silliness. The series never takes itself too seriously.

Game Mechanics
--------------

* Dragon Quest's turns involve each character making an attack or casting a spell to either harm the enemy team or help your own.
* The order of turns is based on each character's speed.
    * Speed changes as a character levels up and equips better armor
* Items can be used in battle to heal teammates or harm enemies.

Crafting Items
``````````````

An important mechanic introduced with DQ XI is forging items in the Fun-Sized Forge.

Forging involves heating up ingredients and hammering them into the desired item.
As a player levels-up, they gain new abilities and stamina to make forging harder items easier.

Forging new items often yields better items than can be bought in shops. However, the player can use
Perfectionist Pearls to improve any equipment or weapons they possess. Improved items are either +1, +2, or +3.
Each of these improvements boosts the stats of an item according to the + value.
