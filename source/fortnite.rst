Fortnite Rating
---------------

Fortnite is a very fun game to play with friends and have fun together on.
However, there are a lot of sweaty players who play the game now and are
competing to be the best players in the world. A lot of these players you
will find in your own lobbies and they will destroy you. Most of these
players ruin all your fun and are too busy trying to sweat. Our rating for
Fortnite is a 7/10.
