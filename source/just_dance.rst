Just Dance
==========

Just Dance is a motion-based dancing game for multiple players,
with each game including a collection of songs each with their own dance
choreographies. During each song, players mirror a dance performed by
actors on the screen, following commands that appear on the screen,
and are awarded for their accuracy. Additionally, there are gold moves
in which players must strike a pose in order to earn bonus points.
Players are given ranks based on how well they do.
