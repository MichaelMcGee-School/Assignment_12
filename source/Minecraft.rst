Where should you start?
-----------------------
Locally there are two different modes you can choose from: survival mode, and creative mode.
In survival mode your character doesn't spawn with any items or food, and must scavenge
around the world to survive. You have a health bar and a food bar. If the health bar drops to zero hearts
you die and drop everything in your inventory. If your food bar drops to zero you slowly take
damage to your health bar until you either eat food or die. There's a day/night cycle which
is very important to keep track of while playing survival. At night there are monsters, also known as
known as mobs, will spawn. There's no true end objective of survival mode, but if you want to "beat"
survival mode you have to make it to the "end" dimension, where you fight a huge dragon boss.

In creative mode you have unlimited resources in your disposal. This means you could make a
mountain of TnT, or a huge castle that would've been almost impossible in survival mode.
In creative mode you don't have to worry about your food bar. Creative mode is meant for
players to create anything they want without the pressure that survival mode brings.
