What Is Super Monkey Ball 2
----------------------------
Super Monkey Ball 2 was developed by Nintendo for the GameCube. It was released
on August 25, 2002. It is the sequel to Super Monkey Ball. Super Monkey Ball 2 is
a level based game where you try to get a monkey inside a ball to roll into the
level's goal while collecting bananas on the way. There are three modes:

* **Challenge mode**
* **Story mode**
* **Party mode**

Challenge Mode
--------------

Challenge mode offers three different level packs: Beginner, advanced and Expert.
You have limited tries and there’s a time limit on each level. You also get some
skips in case you get stuck on a certain level. If you finish a level pack without
using skips you get to enter the pack’s extra levels. In the expert pack, if you
finish its extra levels without using a skip, you get to play the secret master pack.
And if you finish the master pack without using any skips you get to play the master
extra levels.

Story mode
----------

Story mode focuses on the bad Dr. Bad-Boon and the heroines of the story: AiAi, MiMi,
GonGon, and Baby. Dr. Bad-Boon has come from the future to marry the present
time Mimi because, in the future, Mimi marries Aiai. Baby time traveled from the future
as well to stop Dr. Bad-Boon, as Baby is the future child of Aiai and Mimi.
To stop Dr. Bad-Boon, our heroines must once again call on the magic chant to
use the power of the monkey ball! In story mode, you must traverse levels in multiple
worlds to chase Dr. Bad-Boon down. Every level has a time limit, but you have
an infinite amount of tries.

Party mode
----------

Party mode consists of little mini-games for up to 4 people to play. Some mini-games
require you to unlock them before playing them. Six of the games are updated versions
from the first Super Monkey Ball game, and Super Monkey Ball 2 offers six new games to
play. If you want to see all the mini-games you can find them `here <https://strategywiki.org/wiki/Super_Monkey_Ball_2/Minigames>`_:
