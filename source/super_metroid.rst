Super Metroid
=============

*Page author: Michael Andros McGee*

Super Metroid was published by Nintendo in 1994, and is
universally credited as being one of the defining titles
of the Metroidvania genre. A lot of newer generations
will tend to overlook a game like this because it’s old,
but let me tell you: I played this game just a few weeks
ago, and honestly… Super Metroid has quickly became one
of my favorites.

*Super Metroid's Boxart* [1]_

You play as bounty hunter Samus Aran. (The bounty hunter
part is kinda irrelevant, she’s not even working for
money in this game.) She’s tasked with going to planet
Zebes to stop the legion of Space Pirates after stealing
the last member of a dangerous alien species called
“metroids.” They want to clone them because of… reasons.
Space Pirates are evil, metroid bad, stop the bad guys.
The plot is rather bare bones, and a lot of it is told
in the manual. This was done intentionally so that it
can keep the story minimal and told mostly through
subtext. It’s a trade off.

Anyway, most of what you’re going to be doing in this
game is running around exploring so you can find tools
to help you explore more. This is basically the crux of
the Metroidvania genre. You find items that allow you to
access more of the gameworld, and this cycle repeats
itself adneaseum until the game is over. And this cycle
of exploration is certainly very well done. It
frequently feels like there’s a new secret around every
corner, and it’s always enjoyable to trace back over old
areas with new abilities to see what else you can find.
Most memorably, however, is the fact that the game
allows you to break the intended sequence and get new
powerups early. (Another added benefit of the bare bones
story is that doing this does not make the game collapse
under its own weight)
